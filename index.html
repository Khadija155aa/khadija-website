                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Khadija, a devoted food lover with a passion for recreating traditional dishes 
                    and introducing fresh recipes to the world. My mission is to inspire families to gather 
                    around the table and enjoy wholesome, flavorful meals that are simple to make.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I discovered my love for cooking as a child, learning from my family’s rich culinary 
                    traditions. Over time, I’ve developed my own unique approach, combining age-old recipes 
                    with modern ingredients and techniques. From hearty classics to colorful, vibrant meals, 
                    I believe food has the ability to unite people and create lasting memories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not cooking, I enjoy being outdoors, finding inspiration for new recipes, 
                    and transforming timeless dishes into something fresh and exciting. Join me as we 
                    embark on this flavorful adventure, celebrating the joy and connection that food 
                    brings to our lives.
                </p>
